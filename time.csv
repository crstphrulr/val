time
I consider the recommendation right away.
As much as I needed if there were any choices
"when getting the diagnosis, hearing there was a medication which was sent to my pharmacy and I picked up after the appointment, I was on automatic pilot mode not processing the info. It would have been more helpful to have spent more time in the office to speak with the nurse about the diagnosis and the medication."
I was given all the time that I needed
at least a week or so i need to research and weigh options
"A normal amount of time, but sometimes longer"
At least a couple of weeks to lea n
I am trustful of my doctors so I do not hesitate to start treatment when they recomnd it.
"I needed two days to think and research on my own before I accepted the treatment plan. I took exactly the time I needed to be confident and secure with the treatment plan. Of course I would wish for more time to become even more informed, but the time I took was beneficial due to it being short , but not too short to drive an efficient constructive and competent motivated sense of urgency. My mind stayed busy with the sense of urgency and didn't become consumed by worry when the difficult parts of my fact findings were researched and fully understood."
I wish I could take a day or two think things over.
A thorough amount of time is required
I wish it was about three months rather than one
A small amount of time because I just needed a solution
Immediately I did whatever I needed to do
I felt I took the appropriate amount of time to consider my options.
I would of liked them to take a week or two to think about the best treatment and not rush to pill pushing
I wish I had more time to decide and know if insurance would cover it
I had the right amount of time to consider my doctors recommendations.
just ample time to come to terms with my situation
At least a couple of weeks before going to the pharmacy to pick up the meds to start to take them.
I was give the option but wish I had a couple of weeks to decide without feeling like I was losing valuable time
"Really none, I think I thought it through enough"
a couple of weeks but know that it would take that long to get prescription approved by insurance so it would probably be a month before i started it
"A lot of time, I never felt like I had enough."
One time is all it took for them to look at it
No time needed to decide on taking the recommended medicine
24 hours to let it all sink in.
None I'm good with it. I had had enough time.
I am able to make decisions about medications with in a matter of 2-3 days.
I wish I could look it up and see side effects and uses long before I try it or get it called in to pharm
almost none. What choice to I have other than let the cancer bgrow
"I never questioned his prescriptions, just filled them and took them or used them as prescribed - he's the GI UC expert. I hesitated about the Entyvio infusions. There were other choices but he believed Entyvio would be the most successful for me. I wish I had taken his advice immediately about starting Entyvio and then later increasing infusions to every 4 weeks."
didnt need a lot of time to accept docs recommendationbefore accepting it
At least two more weeks want to make sure that there are not many side effects.
I wish it was right away I didn't think it would progress as quickly
I had ample time to figure out things.
I don't need long. Does it work? The sooner I start the medicine the better
I guess I would say at least a few days but no more then a week before accepting it
I had ample time but in a hurry to start treatment
24 hours as I really needed relief of symptoms
24 hours. Inside hospital then a day out of hospital.
"I dont really need a lot of time, I trust my doctor and his recommendations"
There’s not not alot of options I take humerus and two pills
"I don't think about this issue at all. When I have a conversation with my doctor involving a new or change to an existing prescription, I ask the questions that are important to me."
a few days so i can research the side effects
i spend very much time on this si i can get this right for me.
i felt my doctor the right amount of time and i worked on finding my own sources to help get said meds
"very little time, after seeing if insurance covers all"
6 months is the amount of time needed
30 minutes at the least to research it.
Same day if I'm given all the information I needd
Most of the time I travel on doctor's advice
I didn't need any time to consider because the pain would get so intense
Atlases an hour for the pickup
I felt the timing was adequate. My doctor was very informative about the medication and I felt confident
I wish I had a year to consider my doctor's
It was a good idea and I didn’t second guess
A lot longer so I could of read about it first
I wish I had alof of time going about the situation
I wish I had at least 3 more months to prepare
It was good and I would say that an average of two weeks
I like to have about a week to decided
I like to get things over with and dealt with so I accepted it immediately
I wish I had as much time as possible.
Time is a crazy concept tbh it helps with everything
A lot of time I wish I had back
I didn't need much time to think about it
I am content with m u. Yime frame
At least a day In some perspective
The doctor has put me on medication to help me with the pain so I'm just going ahead and doing what I have to do to make sure that everything works out
None. I trust him completely and will accept what they prescribe
"I had all the necessary time I needed, and it did not take long."
After seeing my overall deciding factors for prescription.
I would like time to research the prescription
sooner because the medication really help me
I trust my Doctor and I can read labels and Google the medications.
I wish I would have looked at the pro and cons of the meds being prescribed
I would like two weeks of time.
Immediately and with decisive information available it was not long
"no waiting period because even though prescription filled i could still wait , decide and either do research or speak with dr or dr's before i actually start medication"
At least a few weeks. It's a big decision and would like to look it up
I did not need much time at all.
A week or so to research the medicine and it's pricing and effects.. I had that time. The medicine was very expensive and has specific conditions for taking it
My doctor carries their own prescription in his office
one month is what I would need
"did nto need any time, I went to the doctor to get his advise and diagnosis"
Time is o k to make a decision.
Not very long. I trust my doctor
I would like at least a month to consider taking the medication. I stopped taking Metformin and would never have taken it if I had been given more time to think about it.
A couple weeks would of been nice
30 minutes twenty minutes immediately
A week so that I can do my own research to make an educated decision.
a month is enough time to think about it
I consider that with three month we're suficiently
"Things moved fast, I guess I had enough time."
I was not forced on any timeline by my provider
"I LISTENED TO THEM FIRST, AND CAREFULLY TOOK THEIR ADVICE,BUT NOT WITHOUT ASKING MY HUSBAND FIRST."
"More time, not just a few minutes"
I take the time I need to decide. I go over all the information. And weigh the pros and cons.
Couple of weeks to decide if I want to try the new medication
I take a moderate amount of time to make decisions considering my doctor's recommendation.
I think I ultimately had enough time.
I think I have the right amount of time
I don't think the timeframe really marrered
several years. I'm still not prepared to start treatment
I just wish zhere was an alternative that actually worked that I wouldn't have zo take a prescription for
I fell like my doctor gives me plenty of time to decide
A week should be enough for me to get enough information to make a decision
I wish I had a week or two so that I could do some research about the different medications and how they affect your health re as in side effects
"to me, it's not about time, it's about being properly educated about the medication and it's side effects"
A week to evaluate possible alternatives
I would want at least a week to fully research and understand the treatment
"I think I had the right amount of time, my doctor explained what the medicine was, and how it worked and sent it to my pharmacy. the pharmacist answer and additional questions I had"
I always trust them. I just ask about side effects.
I don't need much time because I trusty doctor.
I took my time to start the prescription
"I wish I had been more prepared prior to the diagnosis, this would have taken a good amount of time for me to research the condition and medications"
I wish I had a few days to think about the pros and cons but sometimes people don’t get that chance. It’s something people have to start right away.
I take the time when he prescribes it. Any issues are resolved before I leave.
A few days time would be best to decide whether to take a medication or not.
I wish i had accepted it way before
i completely trust my doctor and nurse staff. they have my best intintions in mind. they tell me to take it i sure will. they have alwys been there for me
I did not need a lot of time because I trust my doctor very much and he explained things quite well
As much as I needed to take to male a informed choice that I fely comfortable with
Not very much I guess. I don’t know what’s average there.
He gave me plenty of time to make the decision on whether or not to take the medication he recommended.
"I wish I had a few weeks time to consider it. I knew nothing of the medication, yet there was my doctor prescribing it."
"time doesnt matter to me, i really dont care"
The right amount of time for me would be about 3-5 weeks to actually think about and consider my doctors recommended prescription
A few days I usually decide and I go ahead and do what I need to do
At least a day to gather my thoughts
I wish I had a month at least to do the research on my own.
I would need about a week to concider the factors.
Okay in my case initial change of treatment plan cuz it worsened there were several options okay so there was option a option b option c was more serious cuz I had a he had to consult my other specialist so I had at least a week before I went back and we redised it and I went with option easiest and then I'm still open to be your c it's an evolving situation
At least two weeks. U have to b sure.
At least a week so I can do my own research and talk to family members.
"At least a few weeks, like 2 at least."
"He didn't force it on me... he made the recommendation. I asked for time, he gave it to me... my body reset and wr have not had to change meds."
"A couple of days, maybe a week or two."
Enough time to review information on it
"Whatever is convenient and does the job, doctor is an expert in the field."
"I spent 7 years making my decision of whether to get treated or not, and finally decided to do it."
i thought i had a good amount of time
"I would want at least a few weeks, but I’m not set on that time"
"I am not sure what I want to do, more med that could cause MORE injury to my lower GI track"
1 week to 2 weeks or thereabouts
Need very little time to consider meds to be taken
I wish I had at least one week
Trusting my doctor to help in making decisions
A few weeks to do a little research
I had enough time to think about the medication and make my decision
It3 a disease! It had to be taking care of
I wish I had listened to my doctor carefully
I wish I had atleast a few minutes to think about it
Moderate is fine because doctors are trusted professionals
A few days to talk with family
Ummm ok 45 minutes 10 seconds and five years
I need some small time to understand the thinks
"For me time is not an issue, if the medication is going to help me I'm going to take as prescribed."
A week would be enough time to determine risk versus benefit
I believe that I had enough time in the office during the visit to make my decision
A couple weeks so I can investigate the medication and get reviews
I wish we had a good day or two. That I have some time to research the medication
I expect doctors to be knowledgeable about medicines and treatments.
1 day would be enough. Might even be shorter
I decided pretty quickly to try the medication.
"I need a couple weeks to see if it works, but only 1 day to research"
At least a month to consider picking a medication for me
I wish I had a week but I also have a job.
I had ample amount of time to make a decisions
A week would be a lot better then two days because so much new stuff pops up within two days
I wish I had all the time in the world !!
a day oe 2 for me to decide if i will go or reject it or not
A few hours. I need some time to process it but he always knows best
Not long like a week or so so I could look into diffirent options
No to long I trust my doctor and he gave me the best advice to his knowing
"A fair amount of time, maybe a few weeks at least."
A few days to research it if possible
I was anxious for help and accepted it rather quickly.
A while so I can research it so I can feel good about it
"I wish I had months honestly, cause I need to talk to people and other doctors for their opinion or experience with that medicine. Also think about my body and what’s best for me."
I need to talk to my Doctor for 30 minutes to decide if I will take the steroids.
I had enough time. I try to do those things as soon as possible.
I had a couple months to talk about it with my family
The first consultation I was in a desperate state.
Not much more than as I was given as this is a serious situation and treatment should not be prolonged.
I would like to have at least a month to do research and talk to others who have experienced this and maybe who have taken the medications and how it made them feel
Wanted treatment immediately to help
"I like to look up any side affects of the prescription, so with that being said I am above average."
I wish I had at least a weeks more time
A couple of weeks. Enough time to learn about it.
I didn't need any time cuz I don't know what I need like the doctor today
More time like at least two weeks
I had to think about the decision for a couple weeks and then get back to the doctor
"I had plenty of time, no change"
At least a couple months but I’m glad I got it done
I used to think it was a misunderstanding but now I came to terms with it
I wish I had try get treatment sooner
a hour. i really need that time to ponder everything and to really know how it affects me
i had only the time i wsa in my doctor's office during a visit to make the decision on taking the new medication
A few weeks and pray the doctor figures out a new treatment
I feel I used the appropriate amount of time and thought though my options
a nice amount of time without having my health compromised
I would ideally like a few days to research the medication prescribed
It took an hour for me to come to terms with the doctors diagnosis.
I really don't think about time when it comes to my ulcerative colitis it's something I don't like to think about I try to keep it in the back of my mind
I feel I accepted in the right time frame. I trusted my doctor and my daughter is a nurse.
no change i feel like as soon as i was told that i had it thart i needed to start acting against it fast or else it could get out of hand
Atleast 24 to 48 hours to think about and independently research the medication
a lot of time to think about medicationn and treatment options
I was ready to take it when the doctor prescribed and explained it..
I wish I had a whole day to think about it
I don’t need time I just always needed the medication no matter what it was to stop hurting
"I wish I did have a great sufficient amount of time however, in my case I don't if I want to become pain free. I have to trust my doctor and have faith my doctor knows what is best for me."
No time at all. Everything happens right away
"I want enough time to research possible side effects, research what it will cost me and for how long do I need to take it."
it was only about a week i lnew it needed to be done
I could need small time and more experience of it
I wish I had as much time as I needed to make my decision considering it’s hard decision
Alot of time doctors explain the situation
If i had used it maybe it would be better than it is now who knows
I don't wish to spend any time at any doctor office
I have trust and would immediately
At least 72 hrs so I could research and read about it.
I didn't need much time to consider it in this instance. I trust my doctor.
I wish I had a couple days but I didn't it was my only option
I believe I had enough time to make my decision.
I wish I had at least 10 minutes to consider the recommended prescription so I can readily assure myself if this is the route I want to go.
Not much time I knew it would be necessary for me to try the prescription as I had no other options
at least a week and maybe or maybe a few days at the very least
I would say i had a great and normal feedback for the timing jt was perfect there was know rush into me taking the medicine the doctors gave plenty tine to look through important information of the medicine and some of the best suggestions
A lot more time to consider after I had completed my research about the medication
I had good amount of time I checked resources and patients who took it
I wish I had at least 2 weeks.
"In my condition, I do not think having more time would have been helpful. Information is easy to access on the internet and therefore it shouldn't take much time to research and make a decision."
I am just prolonging the inevitable by putting things off and procrastinating
I accept it immediately be ause they are the professional
just several days to a week in time
I would like a significant amount of time to consider taking a prescription or not.
A week or so while I do some research.
It's alright because I absolutely love everything about it and informative
I wish I had just a little more time to consider
i wish i had all of the time in the world but that is just not the reality
I had a week to decide. That was all due to the progress made.
The amout of time was very short and I did not spend very much time to decide.
within 2-4 hours after the doing some research about the medication
Alot more because it is a major decision
"My doctor fully explains why he’s recommending a prescription. He explains the possible side effects. He is disinclined to over prescribe, so I trust him."
No time limit I have no problem with the time I took. I had already researched the radiation treatment. I also was confident with the doctor I had chosen
I think I had the right amount of to consider the prescription
A good week worth oh preplanning!
To take the prescription medication immediately without comment or delay.
"48 hours, so I have time to look it up and learn about it."
"I only need about five minutes to make a final decision because I trust ALL of the physicians I have ever had, especially the specialists I am seeing for this cancer."
no time needed hes expert and knows what hes doing
There was no consideration. I trusted the suggested therapy.
IT WAS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME I DID NOT WANT TO WAIT I WANTED TO GO NOW TO SOONER THE BETTER
I take my time to consider all outcomes
"None at all, it was required or th treatment would not work."
Didn't take long to consider. Had enough time to do what I had to.
I had enough time to consider treatment and researched it also.
Minutes but not many. As I stated earlier I had and still have confidence in my medical team.
i had enought time to think about and study treatment
I never though about it much really.
No time at all it is what it is
Maybe a week or two at the most.
I KNEW BEFORE I LEFT THE DOCTORS OFFICE
A day to think on what I am taking and the procedures I’m taking to get better
I don’t take any time. I fill out the prescription and take it as firected
I knew within 24 hours what I wanted to do
I wish I had more time to decide
i dont need much time after listening to my doctor.maybe 5minutes or so
One week is usually all I need for time.
At least a few months would be the ideal amount of time
none because there was no time needed for a diagnosis that was not life threatening or altering
I want ample time to research and see other info
I usually do it right away making it most efficient and most positive so do that the outcome is positive for a great experience and better opportunity
I hope it's before I get too sick
I wish I'd taken the doctor's advice before I got too sick
A week. Any more than that and I will over analyze
"I accepted the doctors report right away, I am not the type of person who is afraid of making a decision, the sooner the better then you can put it behind you and continue with your life."
I wanted to decide as quick as possible to begin treatment
I think about it every time I take prescription medicine
No time needed. It was clear that it was needed.
Usually just a few days and I can make a decision
I don’t have much time to make choices.
I new that I would have to continue to receive these recommend prescriptions
At least a week to conduct research.
ABOUT ANOTHER WEEK. PREFER TO HAVE A LONG STANDING AND SOUND COMPANY.
I hope you can give me more time
I wish I had enough time to make sure it is going to be affect it ve
Not sure if I can get it with my insurance
I wish I had had at least 7 months to decide whether I was or wasn't going to take it
I wish I gave it less time so I could get the medication right away.
Yes I feel very satisfied with that
I was given time to read papers they gave me along with a website to view. So the time I had was resonable
More than I was given initially
within some days and i really became aware that i need to be fit within few days.
Had a bit less time as I had already been prepared to start treatment
it was a easy process that is really all i can say about it
A day at least to research and find out more on this prescription
It was a no Brainer since my dad and older brother had prostates removed and 1n 1952 my grandfather died from prostate cancer
A couple of days. Wanted time to research other alternatives if there was any
I think it was just right as far as time for research and getting questions answered
I wish I had more time to outweigh the other options before treatment
"I didn't think about the decision for too long. You are in a battle with cancer, so my decision making process was very quick and very precise. I trust my doctor impeccably in her recommendations for my treatment and followed her decision on what course of action to take."
About a week to think about and compare different medications that would work with my prescriptions I already take.
I wish I had at least 2 to 3 weeks to make my decision but I had one day
A week or so would be a good amount of time.
2 weeks because I have to make sure that’s what I really want to do
A few more days at least to come to terms with my diagnosis
More time is better. It should be prescribed
I hit follow my instruction on when and how many to take and what time to take them
At least 20 minutes to decide if I wanted to take the medication or not
After I do research on it and I try to see every little side effects that come with it
I think 20 minutes is about right.
Couple hours and it's ok because I want to know everything right away
I think I spent the right amount of time to consider my doctors recommended prescription.
At least a week to accept or reject
A few weeks to decide. I really wish I could decide sooner.
I wish I had at least a week's worth of time
